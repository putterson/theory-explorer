An interactive music theory tool, geared towards study on guitar.
Currently only displays a fretboard of a selected tuning with the notes from the major scale of a selected key.

## Future
* Show notes, intervals and scales across the whole fretboard
* Pick a chord spelling and show instances of it on the fretboard
* Pick notes on a fretboard and show potential matches with a chord
* Listen to chord instances
* Persistence of custom tunings
* Mobile friendly

## Tech
* State handled by React+Redux
* Drawing of the fretboard using d3 to create svg fretboard
